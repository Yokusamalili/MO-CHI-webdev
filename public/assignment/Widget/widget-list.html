                <p>The Boston Celtics (/ˈsɛltɪks/) are an American professional basketball team based in Boston,
                    Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the
                    league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA teams (out of 23
                    total teams) to survive the league's first decade, the team is owned by Boston Basketball Partners
                    LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey
                    League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The franchise's 17 championships are the most of any NBA team, and
                    account for 24.3 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946.[5] As a
                    percentage of championships won, the Celtics are the most successful franchise to date in the major
                    four traditional North American professional sports leagues.[note 1]

                    The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the finals, including their most recent
                    appearances in 2008 and 2010, where the Celtics have won nine meetings (but only two since 1980).
                    Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most
                    Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP awards.[6] Their mascot 'Lucky the
                    Leprechaun' is a nod to the team's Irish heritage and to Boston's historically large Irish
                    population.[7]

                    The Celtics rose again after struggling through the 1990s to win a championship in 2008 with the
                    help of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen in what was known as the new "Big Three" era,
                    following the original "Big Three" era of the 1980s that featured Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and
                    Robert Parish.

                    After the end of the second "Big Three" era, general manager Danny Ainge began a rebuilding process
                    with the help of new head coach Brad Stevens, who led the Celtics to a return to the playoffs in
                    2015, 2016, and 2017. During the 2016–17 season, the Celtics clinched the top seed in the Eastern
                    Conference playoffs.</p>

                <p>The Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Red
                    Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East
                    division. The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in 13. Founded in
                    1901 as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home ballpark has been
                    Fenway Park since 1912. The "Red Sox" name was chosen by the team owner, John I. Taylor, around
                    1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the "Boston Red Stockings",
                    including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves.

                    Boston was a dominant team in the new league, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World
                    Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the
                    longest championship droughts in baseball history, dubbed the "Curse of the Bambino" after its
                    alleged beginning with the Red Sox' sale of Babe Ruth to the rival New York Yankees two years after
                    their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in
                    2004. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments
                    in World Series history, including Enos Slaughter's "mad dash" in 1946, the "Impossible Dream" of
                    1967, Carlton Fisk's home run in 1975, and Bill Buckner's error in 1986. Following their victory in
                    the 2013 World Series, they became the first team to win three World Series trophies in the 21st
                    century, including championships in 2004 and 2007. Red Sox history has also been marked by the
                    team's intense rivalry with the Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American
                    professional sports.[1][2][3]

                    The Boston Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group, which also owns the Liverpool F.C. of the
                    Premier League in England. The Red Sox are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road
                    attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall
                    attendance.[4] From May 15, 2003 to April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game—a total of
                    820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record.[5][6] Neil Diamond's "Sweet
                    Caroline" has become an anthem for the Red Sox.[7]</p>

                <p>The New England Patriots are a professional American football team based in the Greater Boston
                    region. The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's
                    American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Gillette Stadium
                    in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is located 21 miles (34 km) southwest of downtown
                    Boston and 20 miles (32 km) northeast of downtown Providence, Rhode Island. The Patriots are also
                    headquartered at Gillette Stadium.

                    An original member of the American Football League (AFL), the Patriots joined the NFL in the 1970
                    merger of the two leagues. The team changed its name from the original Boston Patriots after
                    relocating to Foxborough in 1971. The Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium from 1971
                    to 2001, then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the 2002 season. The Patriots' rivalry with
                    the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL.

                    The Patriots have appeared in the Super Bowl nine times in franchise history, the most of any team,
                    seven of them since the arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady in 2000. The
                    Patriots have since become one of the most successful teams in NFL history, winning 14 AFC East
                    titles in 16 seasons since 2001, without a losing season in that period. The franchise has since set
                    numerous notable records, including most wins in a ten-year period (126, in 2003–2012), an
                    undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007, the longest winning streak consisting of regular season
                    and playoff games in NFL history (a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004), and the most
                    consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history (won eight straight division titles from
                    2009 to 2016). The team owns the record for most Super Bowls reached (seven) and won (five) by a
                    head coach–quarterback tandem. The Patriots are tied with the 49ers and Cowboys for the second most
                    Super Bowl wins with five. The Steelers are in front with six. However, the Patriots are the only
                    team to win five Super Bowls with the same coach and quarterback.</p>

                <p>The Boston Bruins are a professional ice hockey team based in Boston, Massachusetts. They are members
                    of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team has
                    been in existence since 1924, and is the league's third-oldest team and is the oldest in the United
                    States. It is also an Original Six franchise, along with the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings,
                    Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs. The Bruins have won six Stanley Cup
                    championships, tied for fourth most of all-time with the Blackhawks and tied second-most of any
                    American NHL team also with the Blackhawks (behind the Red Wings, who have 11). Their home arena is
                    the TD Garden, where they have played since 1995. The Bruins began play in the NHL on December 1,
                    1924. The first facility to host them was what was then known as the Boston Arena (today's Matthews
                    Arena) — the world's oldest (built 1909–10) indoor ice hockey facility still in use for the sport at
                    any level of competition[2][3] — and following the Bruins' departure from the Boston Arena, the team
                    played its home games at the Boston Garden for 67 seasons, beginning in 1928 and concluding in
                    1995.</p>
